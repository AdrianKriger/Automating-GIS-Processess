Grading criteria for the final assignment
==========================================

**The grading is based on a typical 0-5 scale. The grade is based on a total of 50 points:**


**40 points points for major analysis steps/ functionality** (4 x 10 points available for each step):
	- is the desired functionality working as it should (7 points)
	- is each functionality well documented (2 points max per analysis step)
	- is the code written in a modular way (eg. using functions)? (1 point max per analysis step)

**10 points for overall documentation of the work**
	- is there a general description in about the research problem / purpose of the tool?
	- is the usage of the tool/ available functions described and demonstrated clearly?
	- are all input data and output results (maps, graphs) presented and explained clearly?

In addition, you can gain **5 extra points** for other merits in the work:

	- something in the work is exceptionally well done

	- some problem in the code is solved in a "smart" way

	- the work is exceptionally well documented

	- the visualizations are exceptionally good

	- additional features are added (eg. steps 5-6 in accesViz, or some other features that were not required)


This grading criteria applies to submissions which contain the following sections:

1. Data acquisition (Fetching data, subsetting data, storing intermediate outputs etc.)
2. Data analysis (Enriching and analyzing the data, eg. spatial join, overlay, buffering, other calculations..)
3. Visualization (Visualizing main results and other relevant information as maps and graphs)
4. Repeating the steps for another set of input data (eg. another city, or another target location)
5. Good documentation

In case you are creating something with a totally different structure, please discuss with the course instructors :)
