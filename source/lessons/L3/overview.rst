Overview
========

During this week we will learn a few really useful and commonly used GIS functionalities using Geopandas, namely:

1. :doc:`Geocoding <geocoding>` / `Geocoding in Geopandas <../../notebooks/L3/geocoding_in_geopandas.ipynb>`__
3. `Conducting Point in Polygon queries <../../notebooks/L3/point-in-polygon.ipynb>`__
4. `Making Spatial joins <../../notebooks/L3/spatial-join.ipynb>`__
5. `Finding Nearest neighbour of a geometry <../../notebooks/L3/nearest-neighbour.ipynb>`__

Learning goals
--------------

After this weeks' lesson you should be able to:

 - Do geocoding, i.e. converting addresses into Points
 - Conduct Point in Polygon queries
 - Read data from KML files
 - Make spatial joins and table joins between layers
 - Find the nearest neighbour for Point -objects.
