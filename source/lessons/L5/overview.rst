Lesson 5 Overview
=================

This week we will focus on learning how to create beautiful maps in Python and how to share them on GitHub using `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_.

1. `Static maps  <../../notebooks/L5/static_maps.ipynb>`__
2. `Interactive Leaflet maps (Folium and mplleaflet)  <../../notebooks/L5/interactive-map-folium.ipynb>`__
3. :doc:`Sharing interactive maps on GitHub <share-on-github>`
4. :doc:`Exercise 5 <exercise-5>`


As you might remember from our earlier `plotting lesson <https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Lesson-7-Plotting>`_
during the Period I, there are many different Python modules that can be used for making visualizations.

Quite many of them allows you to create also different kinds of maps.

 - `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ (static maps, integrated into `Geopandas <http://geopandas.org/>`_)
 - `Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/>`_ (interactive plots)
 - `Folium <https://github.com/python-visualization/folium>`_ (interactive Web maps on Leaflet)
 - `mplleaflet <https://github.com/jwass/mplleaflet>`_ (converts Matplotlib plots easily to interactive Leaflet maps)
 - `Basemap <http://matplotlib.org/basemap/index.html>`_ (Matplotlib's own mapping module)
 - `GeoViews <http://geo.holoviews.org/>`_

During this lesson we will cover some of these modules in more detail.

Learning goals
--------------

After this weeks lesson you should be able to (at least):

 - Create a static map using Geopandas

 - Create a simple interactive map using Folium (or matplotlib + mplleaflet).

 - Share your maps (static / interactive) on GitHub using GitHub pages.


Lecture videos
--------------

Lecture videos will be added soon.
