Lesson overview
===============

In this week's lesson we will introduce you a spatial data model (geometric objects) and some basics of how spatial data
can be manipulated in pure Python.

1.  :doc:`Motivation for the course: Automating GIS processes <Intro-Python-GIS>`
2. `Shapely and Geometric Objects <../../notebooks/L1/geometric-objects.ipynb>`__

    -  Overview of Geometric Objects and Shapely -module
    -  Point -object
    -  LineString -object
    -  Polygon -object
    -  Geometry collections (optional)

3. :doc:`Exercise 1: Working with geometric objects <exercise-1>`

Learning goals
--------------

After this week you should:

  - have an idea of what kind of tools are available for doing geographic data analysis ("GIS stuff") in Python
  - know how to install Python packages using conda
  - know what kind of geometric objects are available
  - know how to create different kind of geometries using Shapely
  - know how to read coordinates from a file and create Points based on those
